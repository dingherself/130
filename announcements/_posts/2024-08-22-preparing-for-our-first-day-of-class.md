title:  "Preparing for Our First Day of Class"
---

Dear class,

I look forward to meeting you all in class on Tuesday!

If you have not already, be sure to:

- review the course syllabus, reading schedule, and my first announcement (all available on [our course website](https://130.dingthemself.com/));
- read the short article assigned for Tuesday;
- complete the “Getting to Know You” survey (on [D2L](https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/lms/survey/admin/surveys_manage.d2l?ou=1453095)); and
- order the books we’ll be using this semester (see the syllabus for details).

I’m hoping to get us started on some substantive issues on the first day, and we will mostly likely not have the time to go over every aspect of the syllabus and course logistics—so, please come with questions and don’t be afraid to email me if you are unsure about anything.

Finally, the Harvill Building warps spacetime along with everything within it. I posted a [guide](https://130.dingthemself.com/resources/how-to-get-to-our-classroom.html) over on the course website if you don’t want to risk getting lost.

See you all,\
Ding
