title:  "A Few Reminders: Survey, Readings, Shorty, and Link to Documentary"
---

Dear class,

Just a few quick reminders: Please make sure to do the “Getting to Know You” survey (under D2L > [Surveys](https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/lms/survey/admin/surveys_manage.d2l?ou=1453095)), and read the court cases assigned for Tuesday (see our [schedule](https://130.dingthemself.com/schedule.html)). It’s also never too early to start doing your first shorty (you can find instructions under Syllabus > [Assessment](https://130.dingthemself.com/syllabus.html#assessment))!

If you’d like to finish watching the documentary, use [this link](https://ezproxy.library.arizona.edu/login?url=https://digitalcampus.swankmp.net/ua338658/watch/09A9E7F2217CD443) from the library so you wouldn’t need to pay.

Enjoy the long weekend, and I’ll see you in class on Tuesday!

All the best,\
Ding
