title:  "Preparing for Our First Day of Class"

Dear class,

I’m looking forward to meeting you all tomorrow!

If you have not already, please be sure to:

- review the course syllabus, reading schedule, and my first announcement (all available on [our course website](https://130.dingthemself.com/));
- read the short article assigned for Wednesday (see the reading schedule);
- complete the “Getting to Know You” survey (on [D2L](https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/lms/survey/user/surveys_list.d2l?ou=1555706)); and
- order the books we’ll be using this semester (see the syllabus for details).

I’m hoping to get us started on some substantive issues on the first day, and we will most likely not have the time to go over every aspect of the syllabus and course logistics—so, please come with questions and don’t be afraid to email me if you are unsure about anything!

All my best,\
Ding
