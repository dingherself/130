title:  "Announcements: Course Evaluations, Missing Grades, and a Last Extra Credit Assignment"
---

Dear class,

First, I want to encourage you to complete your course evaluations, which will close by midnight on Wednesday, May 7: <https://scsonline.ucatt.arizona.edu/index.php>. I want to hear your feedback! If you have enjoyed the course, tell me about it and use this as an opportunity to reflect on your experience; if you have suggestions about which aspects of the course are and are not working, they will inform and shape the way I teach the class in the future. The results won't be released to me until after I post your final course grades.

Second, I have put in on D2L all of the in-class activity grades that I have. It's certainly possible that I may have missed a few, in which case please let me know as soon as you can and we can fix that.

Lastly, I'd like to give you a last extra credit assignment. For this one, I'm going to ask you to watch the classic (and quite controversial) movie [*Paris Is Burning*](https://www.kanopy.com/en/arizona/video/10910624) (1990), which our library has. After you do, I'll also ask you to read a passage from Jules Gill-Peterson's new book, [*A Short History of Trans Misogyny*](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uaz/reader.action?docID=30734302&ppg=112&c=RVBVQg) (2024) (you might remember her from her apperance in *Framing Agnes*). Unfortunately, the library has only the ebook version, and the page numbers are finicky. The link should take you to a paragraph that starts with the sentence "Confining the trans women of color to the function of inspiring martyr ..." (it's in chapter 3). Please read the next 10 paragraphs till the end of her analysis of the movie.

Here's a bit of context: The academic feminist discussion of the Black and Brown trans women in *Paris Is Burning* following the movie's release (it was very commercially successful) was framed in terms of "male" homosexuality (even though they were talking about trans women) and its "appropriation" or "parody" (depending on how it was viewed) of straight womanhood. Gill-Peterson critiques specifically versions of this framing from two influential feminist theorists, Judith Butler and bell hooks.

To earn up to three extra credit points on your final exam, please write a short (2 to 3 pages) analysis of how Ms. Venus Xtravaganza's story is told—by herself, by the movie, by hooks and Butler, and by Gill-Peterson—as well as how you think her story should be told on reflection. Please upload your analysis to D2L > Assignments by 11:59pm on Friday, May 16.

All my best,\
Ding
