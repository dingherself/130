title:  "No Class or Office Hours Tomorrow (Election Day)"
---

Dear class,

Just a quick reminder that we will not have class or office hours tomorrow because of the election. I hope you have made plans to vote if you are eligible and are preparing yourselves psychologically for the anticipated long wait for the results. In lieu of class, there is a documentary that I’m asking everybody to watch—you can do this anytime before Thursday. The free streaming link is in the [course schedule](https://130.dingthemself.com/schedule.html) (you may need to log into your UofA account).

All my best,\
Ding
