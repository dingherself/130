title:  "Reading for Thursday"
---

Dear class,

Just dropping a quick note to say that we will skip the chapter by Elizabeth Brake originally assigned for Thursday so we can discuss the Claudia Card article that we couldn’t get to today.

Also, I have read all of the shorties submitted for the last couple of classes but unfortunately haven’t found the time to sit down and write comments because of travel. I’m aiming to do that by the end of this week. Sorry about the delay!

All my best,\
Ding
