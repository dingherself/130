title:  "Welcome to PHIL 130: Sex, Gender, and Love!"
---

Dear class,

I hope you’ve all been taking care of yourselves and loved ones, and are excited about the new year as well as the spring semester—I look forward to meeting you on the first day of class, Wednesday, January 15! 

My name is Ding (my pronouns are they/them and she/her). I specialize in trans/feminist theory with a focus on the politics, law, and philosophy of gender. As you can imagine, it’s very exciting to be teaching a class that aligns so well with my own research interests, and I hope it will end up becoming one of your favorites too.

For this class, we will use the university’s [D2L](https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/1555706) system for uploading assignments/viewing grades and then a separate, hopefully-easier-to-use [course website](https://130.dingthemself.com/) for everything else—syllabus, schedule, readings, handouts, etc.

Please be sure to review the syllabus and schedule before the semester begins. **There is a short reading assigned for our first class**—check out the schedule to find out what it is! There are also **two required books** that you’ll need to acquire, and you can find a detailed explanation in the syllabus too (you’ll find one of the books very soon, so do plan ahead!).

I expect most students taking this class to be new to both philosophy and feminist theory. Unlike other courses in the humanities, we are not going to read as many pages a week; instead, you might find the texts a lot denser than you are used to. I strongly encourage you to take the time to read the assigned texts carefully and critically in advance of each class, participate in class discussions actively and regularly, and come to office hours to talk through stuff that you find puzzling. Last but not least, I hope that you will have fun, be challenged, build community, engage with the world around you, and learn to think critically *for* yourself.
