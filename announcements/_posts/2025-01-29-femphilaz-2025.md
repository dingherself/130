Dear class,

Also, our very own annual Arizona Feminist Philosophy Graduate Conference (FemPhilAZ) is next Friday and Saturday (February 7–8), happening both on campus and over Zoom. It is entirely free to register, and you can find the program here:

<https://www.femphilaz.com/>

If you decide to attend any of the FemPhilAZ talks, you can earn up to three extra credit points on your first exam by writing a 2–3 page response paper and turning in a hard copy on Monday, February 17. Please spend roughly half of your response paper summarizing the talk and then the other half critically engaging with it (raise a question, consider a worry, connect it to something we discussed in class, apply it to a new context, etc.).

All my best,\
Ding
