title:  "Ding's Office Hours Are Tuesdays Now"
---

Dear class,

Just a quick note that starting from next week, I'm moving my office hours from Thursdays to Tuesdays. Everything else would be the same. So, same time (2:45 to 4:15) and same place (Social Sciences 138), just a different day of the week (Tuesday instead of Thursday).

Thanks,
Ding
