title:  "Extra Credit Opportunity: Loft Film Fest"
---

Dear class,

Many of the wonderful movies that will be screened at this year’s [Loft Film Fest](https://loftcinema.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lff-2024-program-pages-01.pdf) address themes of sex, gender, and love.

For example, *The Queen of My Dreams* (12/4, 5pm) tells the story of a Pakistani Canadian lesbian coming to terms with her mother after her father’s sudden death, *Maestra* (10/20, 4:45pm) follows women orchestral conductors competing in their only international competition, and *Desire Lines* (10/21, 5:15pm) looks at gay trans masc sexuality.

If you decide to attend any of the Loft Film Fest screenings touching directly or indirectly on sex, gender, and/or love, you can earn up to two extra credit points on your final course grade by writing a 2–3 page response paper and uploading it to D2L > Assignments by Friday, November 1. Please spend roughly half of your response paper summarizing the movie and then the other half critically engaging with it (raise a question, consider a worry, connect it to something we discussed in class, apply it to a new context, etc.).

Let me know if you have any questions!

All best,\
Ding
