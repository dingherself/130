title:  "Plans for Next Tuesday"
---

Dear class,

We didn’t quite get to the two MacKinnon chapters today—that’s totally cool, as I intentionally plan the readings more ambitiously so we always have enough to discuss. Let’s make the Reed-Sandoval chapter originally assigned for next Tuesday optional; I’ll give you the bed-time story version of what happens in there, and you are more than welcome to read it on your own and come to talk to me about it in office hours.

On that point, I have office hours today from 2:45 to 4:15. You don’t need to sign up for anything; just drop by my office in Social Sciences 138. If those times don’t work for you, email me three that would and I’ll get back to you on one that fits into my schedule.

Because we will focus on the two chapters from MacKinnon’s book next Tuesday, you are still welcome to write a shorty on them and I will accept it until noon on Monday. You can find instructions in the syllabus; just post shorties to the D2L discussion board.

Lastly, if I didn’t end up collecting your worksheet for the in-class activity today, just take a photo and email it to me.

See you all on Tuesday,\
Ding
