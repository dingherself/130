title:  "Checking In"

Hi everyone,

I wanted to check in with you to get a sense of how the class is feeling after the news from last night. I understand that this was a particularly heavy event for many of our students, and would like to make myself available to you to talk and refer you to resources. I would also be okay with not having class tomorrow if people may need the space to processâ€”let me know if that is case.

All my best,\
Ding
