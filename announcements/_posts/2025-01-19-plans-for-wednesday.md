title:  "Plans for Wednesday"
---

Dear class,

A quick reminder that we will not have class tomorrow in observance of Martin Luther King Day. In lieu of class, I encourage you to check out a documentary about a legendary but little-known Black trans/queer civil rights lawyer, Pauli Murray, whose work paved the way for both Thurgood Marshall’s argument in *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954, holding that racially segregated schools are unconstitutional) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s argument in *Reed v. Reed* (1971, holding that sexually discriminatory legislation is unconstitutional). Unfortunately, the documentary is only available on Amazon Prime, which requires a membership subscription; so, I’m not requiring you to watch it.

For Wednesday, please follow the [reading schedule](https://130.dingthemself.com/schedule.html) and read Plato’s *Symposium* up to just before the start of Agathon’s speech (172a to 194e); if you have not had a chance to read the short article by Greta Christina assigned for our first day or class or to complete the “Getting to Know You” survey, please do so as well. We will spend half of Wednesday’s class on Christina’s article and the other half on at least the start of the *Symposium*.

I have also posted grades for the first in-class activity. I will use these as a baseline for the final participation grade (I may move up or down taking into account preparation, engagement, contribution in class, discussion in office hours, and respect for others). They are graded on a check-plus (good job!) / check (acceptable) / check-minus (unacceptable) / fail (incomplete) basis. So long as it’s clear to me that you are doing what’s asked, you should expect a check-plus. If you joined the course late, we will excuse this first one.

If you have any questions, please don’t be afraid to ask! I look forward to seeing you all on Wednesday.

All my best,\
Ding
