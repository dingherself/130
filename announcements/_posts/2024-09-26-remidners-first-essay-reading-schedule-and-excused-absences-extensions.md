title:  "Reminders: First Essay, Reading Schedule, and Excused Absences/Extensions"
---

Hi everyone,

A few quick reminders:

- You can find [instructions for the first essay assignment](https://130.dingthemself.com/handouts/essay-i.html) as a handout on the course website. We'll talk about the assignment on Tuesday after you've had a chance to look at it, so please come with questions.
- For Tuesday, we will discuss chapter 12 (and only chapter 12) of MacKinnon's book. We will have to skip the essay by Srinivasan. Then we will watch the movie in class next Thursday as scheduled.
- I understand that people may still need room to process and heal, and will consider these excused absences. If you feel you may need more time to work on the essay, I'm also happy to discuss an extension. Just let me know.

All my best,\
Ding
