title:  "No Class Tomorrow but There Will Be Office Hours"
---

Dear class,

I hope you all had a restful spring break given all that has been happening. Just a quick reminder that in lieu of class tomorrow, there is a documentary that I’m asking you to watch at home (see our schedule for the streaming link). But I’ll still be on campus if you want to talk to me during office hours; otherwise, looking forward to seeing you all on Wednesday!

All my best,\
Ding
