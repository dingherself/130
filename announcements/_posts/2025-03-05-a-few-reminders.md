title:  "A Few Reminders"

Dear class,

Just to finalize what we said in class today:

1. To receive participation points on today's in-class activity, please focus on the very last passage on BDSM and ask and answer the three questions (see [handout](https://130.dingthemself.com/handouts/beauvoir-the-second-sex-iv.html)). Just a couple of sentences would do, and I will mark these on the same check-plus/check/incomplete basis as all other in-class activities. Please do this by the start of class on the Wednesday after spring break, March 19.
2. In lieu of class on Monday, March 17, I will ask you to watch a movie at home after doing the reading. There is a streaming link via the university library that you can find in the class schedule.
3. I will award up to three extra credit points on the second exam to everybody who goes to the free screening of *Outliers and Outlaws* on Thursday, March 27 and writes a short (2â€“3 pages) response paper. Please spend roughly half of your response paper summarizing the movie and then the other half critically engaging with it (raise a question, apply it to your own experience, connect it to something we discussed in class, consider a worry or a complication, etc.). If you choose to do this, please give me a hard copy by Monday, April 7.

Have a lovely spring break,
Ding
