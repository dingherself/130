title: Plato, <em>Symposium</em> - I
module: "Love"
---

*Dialogue*: philosophical conversation written as fictional play/drama, often using real historical figures as characters.

*Symposium*: “drinking together” for aristocratic men.

- Held in the [andron](https://natmus.dk/museer-og-slotte/nationalmuseet/undervisning-paa-nationalmuseet/undervisningsmaterialer/ungdomsuddannelserne/antiksamlingen/vin-og-kaerlighed-det-graeske-symposion/fester-for-guder-og-mennesker/det-graeske-symposion/) (men’s room/cave) of the house, with couches lined  against the walls.
- Dignified women (wives and daughters) are prohibited; but hetairaia (courtesans/mistresses but not hookers) may be hired for entertainment and sex.
- Pursuing intellectual pleasure as well as bodily pleasure: eat, drink, recite poetry, talk philosophy, and have sex.
- Serving as an important site for *pederastic* relationships among male aristocrats:
  - The older, active (i.e., penetrating) *erastês* (“lover”) pursues the younger (~16- to 19-year-old on the verge of full manhood/adult height but not yet fully-beard), passive (i.e., penetrated) *erômenos* (“beloved”), though the *erastês* may not be that much older than the *erômenos*.
  - Educational function: the *erastês* provides moral and intellectual mentorship for the *erômenos*, which the *erômenos* repays with sex (though the *erômenos* is not supposed to *enjoy* being penetrated—that would be too womanly).

*The symposium in Plato’s* Symposium:

- Agathon (tragic poet) won the big prize at the festival; threw a party that night; everybody was hungover the next day but threw another party.
- Socrates (born 469 BCE) attended the festival but not the first party.
- This symposium is set in January of 416 BCE. The following year, Alcibiades (who appears later in the dialogue) led the Sicilian Expedition, eventually suffering a disastrous defeat and defecting to the Spartans—the turning point of the Peloponnesian War.
- but the story we get is told third-hand likely in 404 BCE, just after Alcibiades was assassinated.

## The Opening

- Apollodorus (the narrator): latecomer to philosophy (“love of wisdom”), completely obsessed with philosophy and Socrates (173c–d).
- The layers:
  - Apollodorus tells the story of telling the story to Glaucon two days ago to an unnamed friend.
  - Apollodorus heard the story from Phoenix, who heard it Aristodemus, who was at the party.
- Why this elaborate setup? What the symposiast said ~ how he turned out.
- Aristodemus was not originally invited; Socrates, looking great in his “fancy sandals,” takes him along (174a–d).
- Except Socrates then gets lost in thought (literally). We are not told what he was thinking.
- Agathon (the symposiarch & tragic poet laureate) invites Socrates to sit next to him so he can “catch a bit of the wisdom that came to you under my neighbor’s porch” (175d). Socrates makes fun of him.
- Pausanias (Agathon’s lover) proposes that they go easy on drinking tonight.
- Eryximachus (a physician) dismisses the “flute-girl” (“let her play for herself, or if she prefers, for the women in the house”) so they can engage in serious philosophical conversation; he then proposes that they all make speeches in praise of Love, a suggestion that he credits Phaedrus for (176e–177d).
  - *Erôs* (“passionate love”; *erastês*’s love for the *erômenos*) vs. *philia* (more general, affectionate/non-passionate love; e.g., *erômenos*’s love for the erastês) vs. *agapé* (selfless, benevolent, unconditional love)
- So Phaedrus gets pressured into going first. The speeches will get competitive—the next speaker will try to say that the previous speaker was wrong about something (flirty? erotic?).

## Phaedrus

- The educational function of pederasty is achieved through love (178c).
- More generally, Love directs a person to virtue, “even if she’s a woman” (179b).

## Pausanias

- There are two kinds of Love, because there are two goddesses of Love: the Common Aphrodite vs. the Heavenly Aphrodite (180d–e).

*In-class activity*: What are the two kinds of Love according to Pausanias (181b–d)? Which one is praiseworthy (184c–185c)?

## Aristophanes (Fake Start)

- Aristophanes is supposed to go next, but gets bad hiccups, and so it’s Eryximachus’s turn now (185c).

## Eryximachus

- As a physician, Eryximachus cautions that Love also “occurs within the animal kingdom, and even in the world of plants. In fact, it occurs everywhere in the universe” (186b).
- He also stresses the effects of Love on the body: when Vulgar Love “controls the seasons, he brings death and destruction”; when Heavenly Love is in charge, “men and all other living things are in good health” (188a).
- Aristophanes flirts with Eryximachus (189a–d).

## Aristophanes (Finally)

- Aristophanes writes comedies, and the story he’s about to tell us is hilarious—but is he also serious, or is he just bullshitting for funsies?

*In-class activity*: What, according to Aristophanes, is the origin of Love?

- There used to be three genders: male (the sun), female (the earth), and “androgynous” (the moon) (189e–190c).
  - The original human beings were spherical, with one head, two faces, four legs, four arms, etc.
  - They were too powerful and tried to overthrow the gods.
  - The gods were not happy about this but didn’t want to kill all the humans (then they can’t worship the gods).
- So Zeus proposed cutting the humans in half, turning their face around to look at their wounds, and warning them that if they get bratty again they’ll be split in half again (190d).
  - An original spherical man -> two gay men.
  - An original spherical woman -> two lesbian women.
  - An original spherical androgynous person -> a straight man and a straight woman.
  - (Bisexuals?)
- This didn’t work: the halves would not do anything but embrace each other trying to become one again, not even eat (191a–b).
- So Zeus tried again: he moved everybody’s genitalia around too (191c).
  - So when a male-half embraces a female-half, they can make babies (reproduction “*by* the man *in* the woman”).
  - So when a male-half embraces a male-half, “they would at least have the satisfaction of intercourse, after which they could stop embracing, return to their jobs, and look after their other needs in life.” (What about the lesbians?)
  - The men split from the original spherical men are “most manly in their nature,” and are the only ones “who grow up to be real men in politics. When they’re grown men, they are lovers of young men, and they naturally pay no attention to marriage or to making babies” so they get to do the serious stuff (192a–b).
- Love: longing to become whole with your other half, your meant-to-be (191d–192e).
- Socrates flirts with Agathon (194a ff), whose turn it is now to speak.

## Agathon

- Love is THE BEST!!!!
  - Love is *both* beautiful *and* good.
- Everybody except Socrates loves Agathon’s speech: “In my foolishness, I thought you should tell the truth about whatever you praise” (198d). (It’s not entirely clear, though, whether Socrates went on to tell the truth about Love.)

## Socrates Doing the Socratic Method on Agathon

1. To love is always to love *something* (200a).
2. To love something you have to *desire* that thing (200a).
3. You can’t desire what you already have (desiring to continue to have it in the future is different; the object of the desire is not the thing itself but its preservation) (200b–e).
4. So, to desire something you can’t have that thing already (from 1–3).
5. Love desires something beautiful not ugly (201a).
6. So, “Love needs beauty, then, and does not have it” (201b) (from 4–5).
7. So, Love is not beautiful (from 6). (Agathon: “It turns out, Socrates, I didn’t know what I was talking about in that speech” (201c).)
8. Also, everything good is beautiful (201c).
9. Since Love desires beautiful things, it then also desires good things (201c) (from 5, 8).
10. So, Love also needs but doesn’t have these good things (from 4, 9).
11. So, Love is also not good (from 10).
