## Background

*Property theory of rape*: a wrong against the father or husband as the property owner.

- Property: the woman and her chastity.
- Not a wrong against the woman herself: “crime of man against man” vs. “crime of man against woman” (Brownmiller 1975, 18).
- Just like you can’t steal your own property, you can’t rape your own wife.
  - ~Coverture

William Blackstone, *Commentaries on the Laws of England*: “carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly and against her will.”

- “carnal knowledge” by a man through penile penetration
- “a woman,” not his wife
- “forcibly” + “against his will”
  - The focus is to protect men from the perceived high risk of false accusations: the utmost resistance requirement.

[A.R.S. § 13-611 (1961)](https://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/nodes/view/20941?keywords=DEFINITION%3B%20DEGREES&type=all)

- “accomplished with a female, not the wife of the perpetrator”

## Two Reform Proposals

- Lose consent: redefine rape in terms of force.
  - “Violence, not sex.”
- Lose force: redefine rape in terms of nonconsent.
  - This has become the prevailing approach.
