## What’s different about a <u>philosophy</u> class on sex/gender/love?

The questions we will ask

- are not just empirical but conceptual: “What is love?” -> how has love *in fact* been practiced vs. what does it *mean* to love?
- are not just descriptive but normative: “What is love?” -> how has love *in fact* been practiced vs. what are *good* ways to love? how *should* we love?

In so doing, we will work with primary rather than secondary sources.

## And what’s different about a philosophy class on <u>sex/gender/love</u>?

Ideas are powerful—don’t underestimate them!

- We will think about these questions not just abstractly, but as they bear on the real world, with a view to their real consequences.
- We will approach these questions by working from the margins to the center

## How to approach this class

### Preparing for & participating in class

- Read the assigned texts carefully and critically. Annotate. Bring the readings to class.
- Don’t be afraid to ask right away if you have a question, if I use a word you don’t understand, etc.
- Shorties: don’t bother summarizing; I want to hear your reactions to the reading.
- Lexicon: words are hard; I want to help.
- Respect & take care of each other.

### Extensions & make-ups

- If you email me 6 hours prior to the deadline: no questions asked.
- A little bit later: a little bit of question asked.
- Much later: a legitimate reason expected.
