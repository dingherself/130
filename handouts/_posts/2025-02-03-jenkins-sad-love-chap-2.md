## In-Class Activity

1. Does love happen at first sight, or is love something to be developed over time?
2. Do you believe in a “happy ever after”? Why or why not?

## Limerence vs. Love

*Limerence*: “an involuntary state involving obsessive and intrusive thinking and extremes of positive and negative emotion” (p. 52).

Jenkins argues that limerence is not love:

- You can’t really love someone you barely know, but you can experience limerence for them.
- You can’t really love someone you actively dislike, but you can experience limerence for them.

## Static vs. Dynamic Love

*The Paradox of Happiness*: pursuing happiness as such makes us less happy.

- Jenkins thinks there is a similar paradox of romantic happiness (“the Romantic Paradox”): pursuing the “happy ever after” as such makes us less happy.
- The conception of love as “happy ever after,” for Jenkins, “is an image of static love: ‘happy ever after’ comes at the end of the story because, once it arrives, there’s nothing else to tell. Nothing ever changes” (p. 57)

She proposes an alternative, *dynamic* conception of love: “A healthy relationship is something dynamic that grows and changes over time along with the people in it” (p. 57).

- *Two conceptions of happiness*: hedonic (psychological state) vs. eudaimonic (human flourishing).
- Love that feels sad can nevertheless be good for us!
