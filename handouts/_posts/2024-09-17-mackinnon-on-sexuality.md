## Recap

Recent *NPR* story: [“Domestic violence is now recognized as a leading cause of traumatic brain injury,”](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/13/1238225255/domestic-violence-is-now-recognized-as-a-leading-cause-of-traumatic-brain-injury) March 13, 2024

The situation:

- The pervasiveness of sexual assault (& sexual harassment, domestic abuse, etc.): often cited data are that [one in six](https://rainn.org/statistics/scope-problem) or [one in five](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf) women (compared to 1 in 71 men) in the U.S. experience rape or attempted rape in their lifetime
  - In eight in ten cases, the perpetrator is an acquaintance.
  - In nine in ten cases, the rape targets a woman.
- The under-reporting of sexual assault: data are again tricky, but something like 37% of sexual assaults and 12% of child sexual abuse are reported.
  - Fear of retaliation, victim-blaming, “he said, she said,” etc.
  - Also (this is MacKinnon’s point): line between rape and “normal” sex can be thin in women’s experiences—the latter can involve quite a lot of force, coercion, non consent, etc. So, for all the *wrong* reasons, the men who find it hard to distinguish rape from rough sex are right about something.

The “violence, not sex” response:

- Rape = forced penetration.
  - Gets around the line drawing: rape and sex are categorically distinct.
  - Gets around the victim-blaming: what you are wearing/doing/saying/etc. has nothing to do with whether something counts as rape.
  - Gives an explanation for both the pervasiveness and under-reporting: rape is a weapon of intimidation that men (as a group, not as individuals) use to put women (as a group, not as individuals) in their place.
    - The idea is that it’s a *mass* weapon: rape does not just concern the specific individuals involved; it does and means something to women *as a gender*.
- But this explanation is incomplete: how come *men* get to use this weapon near exclusively?
  - Brownmiller’s answer: the penis is to blame.
  - Do the in-class activity we didn’t get to last time.
- MacKinnon’s critique: This understands rape from the male perspective; it is what men think rape is and why it’s wrong.
  - The focus on penetration: physical intrusion vs. something more.
  - Rape *is* sex: raping the body vs. raping the sexuality; don’t assume that most sex is innocuous.
  - Rape is gendered: even when men are raped, they feel like—and are treated socially as—women; in a way, they are raped *as women*.
  - Rape is not biological: it concerns power of men over women; it’s why rape feels powerful and is used as a tool of asserting power (think rape in wars, prisons, etc.).
  - Rape is facilitated by society: it’s no accident that women find it hard to refuse sex (‘no’ is understood as ‘yes,’ women are taught not to refuse men, sexual attraction from men feels good, etc.).
  - In the end, the two types of rape that actually get taken seriously both serve ideological roles: rape of white women by Black men, and rape [of white women?] by strangers.

The other reform proposal: rape = nonconsensual penetration.

- MacKinnon’s critique: same problem. What counts as consent is understood from the male perspective, which is then taken up as the law’s perspective.

## MacKinnon’s Theory of Sexuality

Some useful observations to start with:

- The term ‘sex’ refers to both sexuality and a system of categorization. Coincidence? No? 
- ‘Having sex’ means something different to men vs. women: ‘getting fucked’ is a bad thing, whereas ‘fuck you’ feels good; women are “soiled” by sex, whereas men are empowered by it.
- What’s sexualized may not involve sex per se (e.g., non-sexual body parts, power/violence), whereas sex need not be sexualized (e.g., the lesbian sex that “doesn’t count”).
- What feels beautiful/feminine for women is very much the same as what is sexually appealing to men: another coincidence?
  - This is particularly a problem for trans women with abusive partners: being abused by a man feels very gender-affirming.

*MacKinnon’s theory*: heterosexuality is the institution of eroticized dominance and submission, which creates the gender division as we know it.

<p style="text-align: center">Male sexual desire: eroticization of dominance and submission<br />↓<br />(Hetero)sexual objectification: men (who dominate), women (who submit)<br />↓<br />Gender: men (who “fuck”), women (who are “rapable”)</p>

Key claims:

- Masculinity and femininity are products of a male sexual desire to dominate: masculinity is dominance eroticized, and femininity submission eroticized.
  - E.g., you feel most feminine when you feel most sexy (to men).
- Men and women are then created through heterosexuality in the model of masculinity/eroticized dominance and femininity/eroticized submission.
  - E.g., women are those who are desired as sexually usable (to men); 
- Sex is a political question: if women’s sexuality is created by male sexual desire, then sexual liberation is not about having more sex or even having less forced, more consensual sex; if working in a sweatshop is not good for you, making it less forced, more consensual does not make it better (if not impossible).
  - Heterosexual love also functions to control women? Domestic abuse cases.
- The role of pornography: for MacKinnon, pornography is a primary mechanism of (hetero)sexual objectification.
  - We’ll come back to this soon.
