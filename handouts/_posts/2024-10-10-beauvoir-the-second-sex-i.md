## In-Class Activity

“Among the blessings Plato thanked the gods for was, first, being born free and not a slave and, second, *a man and not a woman*” (pp. 10–11, emphasis mine).

- Why might one be grateful for this? What does it say about manhood and womanhood?
- If this were you, would you be grateful as well? And what do you imagine Beauvoir’s answer would be if we posed this question to her?

## Beauvoir’s Famous Question: What Is a Woman Anyway?

“Very simple, say those who like simple answers: She is a womb, an ovary; she is a female” (p. 21).

- But this can’t be right: it fails to explain how we think and talk about womanhood (p. 3).
- Rather, being a woman has to do with this “femininity” business: “So not every female human being is necessarily a woman; she must take part in this mysterious and endangered reality known as femininity” (p. 3).

So, what is this “mysterious” thing called “femininity” or “womanhood”?

- The traditional philosophical answer: it is an innate nature/essence.
  - Beauvoir: not reputable.
- The “American” answer: there is no such thing as “femininity” or “womanhood”; we are all *just* human beings.
  - Beauvoir: not helpful.

Beauvoir’s own answer:

- Against the traditional philosophical answer: womanhood is a *social* situation/becoming.
  - The famous sentence: “One is not born, but rather becomes, [a?] woman” (p. 283).
- Against the American answer: moreover, it is an *unequal* social situation/becoming.
  - “He is the Subject; he is the Absolute. She is the Other.”

## How did women become the Other?

- Generally: “It is often numerical inequality that confers this privilege: the majority imposes its law on or persecutes the minority.”
  - Is this right?
  - Women don’t have a numerical disadvantage.
- Women’s subordination “is not the consequence of an event or a becoming, it did not *happen*” (p. 8).
  - Did it not happen? Notice Beauvoir implicit coding of women as white and bourgeois, all while Black people, proletarians, Jewish people, and Indigenous people are assumed to be male.
- Also not because of nature.
  - Even sexual reproductive does not require a binary system of sex categorization (pp. 21ff).
  - Brain size example (pp. 40ff): biological facts “do not carry their meaning in themselves” (p. 46); what matters is the meaning that *we* ascribe to biology.
- Still, what gave men the advantage? 
  - Women are stuck with biological reproduction; men get to create values and meanings (pp. 71–75).
  - Womanhood is a response to a situation.
  - How does this differ from the “nature” answer?
