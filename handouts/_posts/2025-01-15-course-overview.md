## What’s different about a <u>philosophy</u> class on love/gender/sex?

The questions we will ask

- are not just empirical but conceptual: “What is love?” -> how has love *in fact* been practiced vs. what does it *mean* to love?
- are not just descriptive but normative: “What is love?” -> how has love *in fact* been practiced vs. what are *good* ways to love? how *should* we love?

In so doing, we will

- work with primary rather than secondary sources;
- focus on conceptual analysis, philosophical arguments, close reading, and charitable but critical interpretation; and
- engage with our authors as equal participants in a long conversation.

Think of philosophy as an *activity*: for me, a philosophy classroom is not where students come to passively learn about different philosophies (though we will of course do a lot of learning!), but where we come to *do philosophy together*.

## And what’s different about a philosophy class on <u>love/gender/sex</u>?

Ideas are powerful—don’t underestimate them!

- We will think about these questions not just abstractly, but as they bear on the real world, with a view to their real consequences.
- We will approach these questions by working from the margins to the center.

## How to approach this class

### Preparing Before Class

(1) Read the assigned texts carefully.

- Keep track of definitions and distinctions (don’t take anything for granted!)—add these to your lexicon.
- Distinguish a thesis and an argument for a thesis.
- Distinguish where an author is speaking for themself vs. where they are describing someone else’s view (without endorsing it) or considering worries/objections
- Annotate, and develop your own annotation system!

(2) Read the assigned texts critically.

- Write down your thoughts/reactions in the margins as you process the reading: does this make sense? does this sound right? how do I feel? do I have questions?
- Think about the reading as a whole: do you think what the author is saying is not only right but well-argued? if not, why not?

(3) Bring the readings to class!

### Participation in Class

General class structure: brief introduction -> small group discussion -> whole class discussion -> what I want you to out of from the reading -> whole class discussion.

- Don’t be afraid to ask right away if you have a question, if you are not sure what we are doing, if I use a word you don’t understand, etc.
- There will be a handout posted the course website; take your own notes as well.
- Lexicon: words are hard and I want to help.

Let’s take care of each other!

- Some of the materials will be difficult for a lot of students, and I’m here if you need to talk.
- You can disagree in a way that takes another person’s ideas seriously.
  - Philosophy is a whole lot of disagreements!
  - When I challenge you with follow-up questions, this doesn’t mean I’m upset with you!!
  - Sometimes people read my sense of humor as passive aggression—I apologize in advance.

### Office Hours

- No signups needed; lollipops provided.
- Come to talk to me about the substance and the logistics of the course.
- I would also genuinely love to get to know you more!
- If my office hours don’t work for you: propose three or four times for an appointment.

### Emergencies

Please reach out if there’s something going on in your life (it happens!).

Absences:

- Email me if there’s a reason you can’t come to class (I consider mental health a legitimate reason for missing class).
- To catch up: do the reading, read the handout, get notes from at least two classmates, and come to office hours to discuss any questions/thoughts you have.

Makeups & extensions:

- If you email me 6 hours prior to the deadline: no questions asked.
- A little bit later: a little bit of question asked.
- Much later: a legitimate reason expected.
