title: 'Greta Christina, “Are We Having Sex Now or What?”''
module: "Introduction"

Discussion questions:

1. How has the answer to “what is sex?” become so not obvious to our author? Which potential answers has she tried, and why do they not work?
2. Think about the bigger picture as well: What’s the point of deciding whether something counts as sex? (Is there such a point?) Who has made that decision for us? (Is it the right decision? Should they get to decide in the first place?)

Some takeaways to continue to reflect on:

- I want to encourage us to get more and more comfortable uncovering and challenging implicit, taken-for-granted assumptions : “Sex is defined as …” -> by whom? who gets to say what sex is? on what grounds?
- Philosophical questions like “what counts as sex?” can have real-world political consequences (i.e., they are not “value-neutral”): when sex is assumed to be penis-in-vagina intercourse, whose perspectives are being left out? whose interests are being served?
- It is useful to theorize “from margin to center”: thinking about what sex is to queer women helps to shed light on what sex is for straight women, but not vice versa.
- Philosophy is not merely “opinions”: we can make a case for/against a position without resorting to authority, religion, etc.
- Most importantly, I want us to learn to think critically and reflectively *for* ourselves.

Themes we will revisit later on:

- What counts as sex is a decision *we* make?
- Rape: violence, not sex?
- Relationship: what does sex have to do with it?
- BDSM: sexual ≠ erotic?
- Trans people exist?
