## The Controversy over Lesbian Sadomasochism

Context:

- 1995 was the peak of the AIDS epidemic: ~50,000 deaths in the U.S. that year.
- The influence of Carol Gilligan’s *In a Different Voice* (1982): care-based feminine morality vs. rights-based masculine morality.
- Bitterness toward the feminist movement: “queers of the queer”
  - Butch/femme, trans people, BDSM, etc. were seen as part of the patriarchy to be smashed (“reproducing” or “internalizing” patriarchy, perpetuating “male violence,” etc.).
- Move toward respectability politics: lesbian as a subcultural social system that organizes sexuality ->  lesbian as a political identity -> lesbian as a desexualized individual trait.

The irony: the “sexual revolution” aimed to transform our relationships and our sexualities, but then when somebody actually did it people got really upset.

Contemporary influences:

- The focus on pleasure and agency.
- The language we use to describe sexual desires (e.g., top/vers/bottom vs. dominant/switch/submissive vs. masculine/feminine).
- Models of sexual consent (Anderson).

## Models of Sexual Consent

Historically: lack of utmost resistance = consent.

Two contemporary proposals:

- “No means no”: utterance of “no” = non-consent
  - This presumes consent unless and until “no” is uttered.
- “Yes means yes”: utterance of “yes” = consent
  - This presumes non-consent unless and until “yes” is uttered.

Problems for both models:

- If nonverbal communication does not count:
  - The No Model: ﻿physical paralysis, dissociation, etc.
  - The Yes Model: bodily communication.
- If nonverbal communication does count:
  - The No Model: ﻿falls back to the use of physical resistance as non-consent -> still subject to physical paralysis, dissociation, etc.
  - The Yes Model: men systematically misinterpret clothing, drinking, eye contact, causal touch, flirting, hugging, kissing, petting, etc. as consent.
- The ambiguity of what is being consented to: kissing and petting can be separate and independent sexual acts on their own without having to lead to penetration.
- To give consent is to give permission to be acted upon: this puts women in a passive position for men to act on.

Anderson’s alternative:

- ﻿﻿Negotiation: “an active consultation with someone else to come to a mutual agreement”
- ﻿﻿The Negotiation Model requires “meaningful consultation” between the parties prior to the sex in order to arrive at a mutual agreement.
- ﻿Negotiation -> agreement -> sex (+ use of safe words).
- Nonverbal negotiation only workable within long-term relationships.
