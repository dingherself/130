title: Beauvoir, <em>The Second Sex</em> – IV
module: "Gender"
---

## Recap

Two interpretations of Beauvoir:

- *The social constructivist reading*: womanhood is the social meaning of a female biology.
  - “One is not born, but rather becomes, woman”: society makes one into a woman.
  - The problem is with the social institution of womanhood: it is a second class.
  - Note that the social constructivist reading presumes some clean separation of biology and society. Is this tenable?
- *The existentialist reading*: womanhood is a response to a female situation.
  - “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman”: one’s choices make oneself into a woman.
  - The problem is with the situation socially given to women: the world revolves around men, works by standards set by men; “the horizon is blocked for [women].”

Possibility for resistance?

- *The social constructivist reading*: reform the social institution of womanhood? abolish it?
- *The existentialist reading*: not immediately clear?

## Reverse Jigsaw

*Each group should have at least one of: a cat person, a dog person, a bird person, a fish person, and a lizard person. With your group, work through the following questions for the passage assigned (we will work on one passage at a time); then find classmates of your species and share your group’s answers with them.*

- What is a social constructivist reading of this passage?
- What is an existentialist reading of this passage?
- What difference does reading the passage in these two contrasting ways make?
