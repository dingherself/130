module: "Gender"

## Recap

Two interpretations of Beauvoir:

- *The social constructivist reading*: womanhood is the social meaning of the female biology.
  - “One is not born, but rather becomes, woman”: society makes one into a woman.
  - The problem is with the social institution of womanhood: it is a second class.
- *The existentialist reading*: womanhood is a response to the female situation.
  - “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman”: one makes oneself into a woman.
  - The problem is with the situation socially given to women: the world revolves around men, works by standards set by men; “the horizon is blocked for [women].”


One example: pp. 329, 320.

Possibility for resistance?

- *The social constructivist reading*: reform the social institution of womanhood? abolish it?
- *The existentialist reading*: not immediately clear?

## Beauvoir on Women’s Responses to the Situation of Femaleness

| Situation                                                    | Response                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Logic and abstraction are useless to domestic lives (p. 639). | Women turn to the mysterious and the spiritual.              |
| Women have little influence on the course of history (p. 641). | Women resent change.                                         |
| Domestic work is boring, repetitive (p. 643).                | Women become petty, mean, lazy, etc.                         |
| Women are tied to their individual families (p. 645).        | Women do not recognize the value of solidarity.              |
| Women do not find the world safe and trustworthy (p. 645).   | Women worry all the time.                                    |
| Husbands do not treat wives well (p. 647).                   | Women revolt through complaints, tears, and theater.         |
| Domestic work has no higher meaning/importance (p. 649).     | Women seek male affection for validation.                    |
| Morality blames women for men’s sins (p. 652).               | Women recognize the hypocrisy and play along.                |
| Men want women to submit, but freely (p. 653).               | Women treat it as playacting/a kink.                         |
| Women experience their bodies as a burden (p. 657).          | Women do not believe that the world is harmonious.           |
| Women are stuck in the immanent/worldly (p. 659).            | Women turn to religion, aiming for transcendence in the heaven. |

The problem: being a free, autonomous human being is incompatible with being a woman (pp. 723–25).
