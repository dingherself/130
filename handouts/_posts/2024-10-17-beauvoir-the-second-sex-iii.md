title: Beauvoir, <em>The Second Sex</em> – III
module: "Gender"
---

## Recap

Two interpretations of Beauvoir:

- *The social constructivist reading*: womanhood is the social meaning of the female biology.
  - “One is not born, but rather becomes, woman”: society makes one into a woman.
  - The problem is with the social institution of womanhood: it is a second class.
- *The existentialist reading*: womanhood is a response to the female situation.
  - “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman”: one makes oneself into a woman.
  - The problem is with the situation socially given to women: the world revolves around men, works by standards set by men; “the horizon is blocked for [women].”


One example: pp. 329, 320.

Possibility for resistance?

- *The social constructivist reading*: reform the social institution of womanhood? abolish it?
- *The existentialist reading*: not immediately clear?

The problem: being a free, autonomous human being is incompatible with being a woman (pp. 723–25).
