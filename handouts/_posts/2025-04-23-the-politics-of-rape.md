## Background

Recent *NPR* story: [“Domestic violence is now recognized as a leading cause of traumatic brain injury,”](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/13/1238225255/domestic-violence-is-now-recognized-as-a-leading-cause-of-traumatic-brain-injury) March 13, 2024

The situation:

- The pervasiveness of sexual assault (& sexual harassment, domestic abuse, etc.): often cited data are that [one in six](https://rainn.org/statistics/scope-problem) or [one in five](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf) women (compared to 1 in 71 men) in the U.S. experience rape or attempted rape in their lifetime.
  - In eight in ten cases, the perpetrator is an acquaintance.
  - In nine in ten cases, the rape targets a woman.
- The under-reporting of sexual assault: data are again tricky, but something like 37% of sexual assaults and 12% of child sexual abuse are reported.
  - Fear of retaliation, victim-blaming, “he said, she said,” etc.
  - Also (this is MacKinnon’s point): line between rape and “normal” sex can be thin in women’s experiences—the latter can involve quite a lot of force, coercion, non-consent, etc. So, for all the *wrong* reasons, the men who find it hard to distinguish rape from rough sex are right about something.

*The property theory of rape*: rape wrongs the father or husband qua property owner.

- Property: the woman and her chastity.
- Not a wrong against the woman herself: “crime of man against man” vs. “crime of man against woman” (Brownmiller 1975, 18).
- Just like you can’t steal your own property, you can’t rape your own wife.
  - ~Coverture

William Blackstone, *Commentaries on the Laws of England*: “carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly and against her will.”

- “carnal knowledge” by a man through penile penetration
- “a woman,” not his wife
- “forcibly” + “against his will”
  - The focus is to protect men from the perceived high risk of false accusations: the utmost resistance requirement.

[A.R.S. § 13-611 (1961)](https://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/nodes/view/20941?keywords=DEFINITION%3B%20DEGREES&type=all)

- “accomplished with a female, not the wife of the perpetrator”

## Contemporary popular understanding of rape

- Rape arises out of sexual desires/needs/impulses; it is a response to sexual “provocation” and is in some important connected to testosterone and the penis.
- Rape is really easy to accuse a man of.
- Rape is rare, but also the line between rape and “rough” sex is thin.
- The imagined Black rapist in a dark alley.
- “No” means “yes.”
- Rape is a private, individual issue; it is between one man and one woman (or perhaps the woman’s husband or father).

*In-class activity*: Please read the poems by [Sharon Olds](https://voetica.com/poem/4925) and [torrin a. greathouse](https://archive.org/details/torrina.greathouseinanoperatingroomoutsideoftheciswomansimagination).

- What is the point that Olds is trying to make?
- Why does greathouse find it demeaning?

## Reconceptualizing rape as a political problem

MacKinnon’s critique: We are understanding rape only from a male perspective; it is what men think rape is and why it’s wrong. But we should understand rape on women’s terms.

- The focus on penetration: physical intrusion vs. something more.
- Rape is gendered: even when men experience rape, they often feel like they are treated like women; in a way, they are raped *as women*.
- Rape is not biological: it concerns power of men over women; it’s why rape feels powerful and is used as a tool of asserting power (think rape in wars, prisons, etc.).
- Rape is facilitated by society: it’s no accident that women find it hard to refuse sex (‘no’ is understood as ‘yes,’ women are taught not to refuse men, sexual attraction from men feels good, etc.).
- In the end, the two types of rape that actually get taken seriously both serve ideological roles: rape of white women by Black men, and rape [of white women?] by strangers.

## MacKinnon’s theory of sexuality

Some useful observations to start with:

- The term ‘sex’ refers to both sexuality and a system of categorization. Coincidence? No? 
- ‘Having sex’ means something different to men vs. women: ‘getting fucked’ is a bad thing, whereas ‘fuck you’ feels good; women are “soiled” by sex, whereas men are empowered by it.
- What’s sexualized may not involve sex per se (e.g., non-sexual body parts, power/violence), whereas sex need not be sexualized (e.g., the lesbian sex that “doesn’t count”).
- What feels beautiful/feminine for women is very much the same as what is sexually appealing to men: another coincidence?
  - This is particularly a problem for trans women with abusive partners: being abused by a man feels very gender-affirming.

*MacKinnon’s theory of sexuality*: heterosexuality is the institution of eroticized dominance and submission, which creates the gender division as we know it.

<p style="text-align: center">Male sexual desire: eroticization of dominance and submission<br />↓<br />(Hetero)sexual objectification: men (who dominate), women (who submit)<br />↓<br />Gender: men (who “fuck”), women (who are “rapable”)</p>

Key claims:

- Masculinity and femininity are products of a male sexual desire to dominate: masculinity is dominance eroticized, and femininity submission eroticized.
  - E.g., you feel most feminine when you feel most sexy (to men).
- Men and women are then created through heterosexuality in the model of masculinity/eroticized dominance and femininity/eroticized submission.
  - E.g., women are those who are desired as sexually usable (to men); 
- Sex is a political question: if women’s sexuality is created by male sexual desire, then sexual liberation is not about having more sex or even having less forced, more consensual sex; if working in a sweatshop is not good for you, making it less forced, more consensual does not make it better (if not impossible).
  - Heterosexual love also functions to control women? Domestic abuse cases.
- The role of pornography: for MacKinnon, pornography is a primary mechanism of (hetero)sexual objectification.
